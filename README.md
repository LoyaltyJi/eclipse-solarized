Eclipse Solarized Color Theme
=============================

This is a theme for Eclipse, intented to be installed via the [Eclipse Color Themes plugin](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/).
It is based on the great [Solarized ](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme created by Ethan Schoonover and was originally implemented by Miguel Cervantes. His version can be found [here](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=1115).

I just made some modifications to my liking.

Improvements
============

- Highlight the current line (in base02 color)
