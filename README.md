Eclipse Solarized Color Theme
=============================

This is a Theme for Eclipse, intented to be installed via the [Eclipse Color Themes Plugin](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/). It is based on the great [Solarized ](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme created by Ethan Schoonover and was originally implemented by Miguel Cervantes and can be found it its original form [here](http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=1115).

I just made some modifications to my liking.
